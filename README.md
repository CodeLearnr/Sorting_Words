# Sorting_Words
Write a C# program that accepts a sentence and outputs every word in a line based on their length. [Note: Use at-least one foreach loop in your solution. You are allowed to use other loops as well.] Example: Input: This is a programming example Output:  a  is  This  example  programming   Bonus: Sort words of same length according to the rule of string comparison i.e. If the first character from the first string is greater (or less) than the other string's, then the first string is greater (or less) than the second and so on. Example: Input: Alex is good with programming Output:  is  Alex  good  very  well  with  programming
